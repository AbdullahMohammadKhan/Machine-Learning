VGG_coupled_train.py: Train two VGG16 models which are coupled and we are trying to minimize the Euclidean distance between the feature vectors in the coupled layer.

VGG_contrastive_train.py: Train two VGG16 models which are coupled and we are trying to minimize the contrastive loss between the feature vectors in the coupled layer.

VGG_siamese_train.py: Train two Siamese VGG16 models which are coupled and we are trying to minimize the Euclidean distance between the feature vectors in the coupled layer.
